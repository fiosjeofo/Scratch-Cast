Scratch Cast even supports broadcasting your mouse's position data dynamically to Scratch and Captions! (check config file for captions)

There is no security on WHO can stream to a project, anyone with this script can stream to ANY copy of Scratch Cast. 
There is NO way to fix this due to Scratch's lazy security.

Quickstart guide:

You should be able to run the python file directly from Command Prompt, but if that does not work;
You will need Python IDE of somekind. If you don't plan to code with python, install Thonny (https://thonny.org/)
The Scratch project incuded in the folder you must upload to Scratch first. Then get the ID of the project and paste it in the config file. 

YOU MUST FILL THE INFORMATION IN "config.txt" BEFORE YOU RUN THE PROGRAM.

Open the Scratch Cast Python file in Thonny (or Command Prompt if it works)

After you've done that, start the program (green button) and wait for the libs to download (or skip them if you already have them downloaded by going in config.txt)

And you're off! have fun!
